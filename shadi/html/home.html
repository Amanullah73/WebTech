                        <strong>Dating 101:</strong> When on a date, switch off your phone. Nothing is more insulting to a girl than a man answering every call while on a date. You are allowed to make a small deal about turning off your phone at the start of the date with acomment like "Now we will not be disturbed". Power down your phone or lose your date. Can't have both.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Dating 102:</strong> Leave your ego at home. A lot of guys are too sensitive. If she giggles because you made a small mistake, instead of getting angry or defensive, try laughing at yourself. Remember she is as nervous as you are (or more!) and it could just be her nerves showing. <br>
                        Another ego issue is your treatment of people around you. Waiters, valet, taxi drivers, or cooks may not follow your instructions. Your interaction with these people will show her how you will act with her when the newness has worn out. Always be kind, generous, and forgiving. (that last one is something we should all aspire to all the time).

                        <strong> Dating 103:</strong> First date rules: <br>
                        Friends have set you up. What to do next? Call her or him and discuss the following: agree on where to go, what time, do you go together or meet there? What is the dress code? (that is kind of important to women). She does not want to dress to the nines and find you with old jeans and a faded T-shirt. <br>This phone call is important for another reason. It breaks the ice and allows both to feel out the other person. Keep it short (less than 10 minutes).

                        <strong>Dating 105:</strong> Can I hold your hand?
                        First dates can be exciting but tricky, especially regarding physical contact. <br>
                        Here's a guide to help: <br>
                        • Respect Personal Space: Start with a handshake or friendly hug, based on cultural norms and comfort levels. <br>
                        • Build Trust: Focus on conversation and shared interests, allowing physical contact to develop naturally. <br>
                        • Prioritize Consent: Always ask for permission before initiating any touch. <br>
                        • Read Signals: Pay attention to body language and verbal cues to gauge comfort. <br>
                        • Consider Context: Adapt physical contact based on the setting, whether public or private. <br>
                        • Communicate Openly: Discuss expectations and comfort levels to avoid misunderstandings. <br>
                        • Respect Boundaries: Honor your date's comfort level, even if it differs from yours. <br>
                        By prioritizing respect, communication, and consent, you can ensure a positive and respectful first date experience.
